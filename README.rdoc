= iParse - iTunes Plist Parsing for Rails

Not quite ready for prime-time. The Gem was created with [Jeweler](https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler). If you want to install, run the command <pre><code>rake install</code></pre> in the directory. The gem will then be available for your projects.

I hope to release the gem to Rubygems soon.

==To Do
* Write tests!
