iParse - iTunes Plist Parsing for Rails
-----

Not quite ready for prime-time. The Gem was created with [Jeweler](https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler). 
If you want to install, run the command <code>rake install</code> in the directory. The gem will then be available for your projects.

I hope to release the gem to Rubygems soon.

To Do
=====
* Write tests!
